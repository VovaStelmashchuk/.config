## Just a random guy config

Hi there. My name Vova, Your are in my `.config` folder. The project contains my configuration files for nvim and wezterm.

## Installation

Your cannot just close the repo into your `.config` directory, because it contains a lot of files that are not needed for the project. 
So here an alternative way to install getting all configs. 

Navigate to your `.config` directory and run the following command:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:VovaStelmashchuk/.config.git
git fetch
git checkout -b main origin/main
```
