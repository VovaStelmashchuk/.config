## Vova's NeoVim configuration
The project is my personal configuration of NeoVim. **It is not a plugin**. It is a set of config and keymaps etc.
You have no reason to use it, but you can take some ideas from it. \

The setup include the following:

- Lazy as plugin manager
- LSP done by nvim it self
- Remaping for dvorak layout (htns)
- NeoTree for file explorer
- TreeSitter for syntax highlighting

Installation of LSP servers
```bash
npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server
npm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted
npm install -g @tailwindcss/language-server
pip install pyright
```
